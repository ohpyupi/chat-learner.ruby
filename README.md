# Chat Learner in Ruby

This is a toy project to build a chat bot that can be taught how to answer a user's question.

Basically, when you type your question, the bot will search a dictionary table whether the corresponding question/answer pairs are already stored or not. If found, the bot will answer your question choosing randomly a possible answer. If not found, it will ask you to teach a possible question/answer pair and store it in the dictionaly table.

To test the bot,
`
rails s
